# Carbon-Dollar
Replacing electrical PoW with sequestered Carbon

PROS:
Creating the token off the blockchain is the easy part.
A carbon dollar will be internationally acceptable.
Value is in tons of sequestered carbon, the more tons sequestered, the more money there is.
Sequestered Carbon is a natural resource akin to oil reserves.

In a sense a Carbon credit is a Proof of Work. (Bitcoin model) Whereas Bitcoin PoW requires energy/electricity as its input, this model can work on tons of sequestered carbon.

Challenges:

- Issuance via an exchange
- Where does the blockchain reside
- PoS blockchain
