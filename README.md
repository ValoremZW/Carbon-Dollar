1. Core Operating Principles
• Ecology constrains economics.
• Doctrine constrains finance.
• Failure modes are defined in advance.
2. Dual-Token Architecture
• BDR functions as a non-financial ecological reserve asset.
• BIO functions as the system’s utility and participation layer.
• No peg, reserve ratio, or quantitative linkage shall exist between BDR and BIO.
3. Bio Dynamic Regeneration (BDR) Doctrine
• BDR records ecological memory witnessed through time.
• BDR is not priced, traded, collateralised, or financialised.
• BDR functions analogously to gold on a central bank balance sheet.
• BDR issuance tightens as ecological maturity increases.
4. BioDollar (BIO) Participation Layer
• BIO represents time-bound participation under ecological constraint.
• Qualification occurs only at defined thresholds.
• Accumulation beyond qualification confers no additional entitlement.
5. Proof of Protection (PoP) & Proof of Regeneration (PoR)
• PoP recognises restraint, not activity.
• PoR recognises only net ecological state improvement persisting across defined stress
intervals.
• Effort, expenditure, intent, and compliance have no independent standing.
6. Ecological Difficulty Adjustment (EDA)
• EDA increases proof thresholds and verification intensity as ecosystems mature.
• Scarcity emerges from ecological success, not administrative cap.
7. Alignment Bonds & Participation Doctrine
• Alignment Bonds are negative-yield obligation commitments.
• They confer no yield, authority, governance rights, or entitlement.
• Redemption is permitted but deliberately unattractive and resets eligibility.
8. Sacred Access Doctrine
• Sacred knowledge enters only by explicit custodian permission.
• Financial contribution confers no entitlement.
• Presence does not mature into authority.
9. Treasury Architecture
• BDR held per project as ecological reserve.
• Operational cashflows strictly separated from ecological reserve.
• BIO absorbs economic stress; BDR remains indifferent.
10. Canonical Axioms
• Community is the Operating System.
• We do not price nature, because nature is priceless.
• Consensus by endurance is established only by that which perseveres under defined stress
through time.
• Legitimacy arises from named human roles remaining bound to outcomes through time.
• u-Kama does not optimise for throughput; it optimises for continuity under constraint.
